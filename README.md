# Portfolio

This is a repository of what I consider interesting notebooks and code.  Some are jupyter notebooks and others are RMarkdown compiled as pdf files.  I have also included links to a simple video that was created by adopting and adapting code from the Automatic R Instructor repository from Johns Hopkins.  I also have a link to a video I created with Camtasia for use in my flipped classroom.  The following is a summary of the files in this repository:

[Naive Bayes Classifier - Warner.ipynb](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes%20Classifier%20-%20Warner.ipynb) is a project I wrote on developing a simple naive Bayes classifier. To complete, you have to import data, clean it and get it into a useful form, perform basic exploratory analysis and resampling based inference, and finally build the classifier. 

[Cadet Seating for Test Project.ipynb](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Cadet%20Seating%20for%20Test%20Project.ipynb) is a notebook for a discrete math class. This notebook has mathematical and computational solutions to a difficult counting problem.

[Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer - v2 with my images.ipynb](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Art%20Generation%20with%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer%20-%20v2%20with%20my%20images.ipynb) - This file is from the Coursera course on convolutional neural networks https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks. I completed the code and added some additional code of my own.

[Final Project Notebook 3 Solution.ipynb](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Final%20Project%20Notebook%203%20Solution.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook I created for my course on statistical and machine learning.  I adopted a notebook from the Edx course from Databricks for my class.  This notebook is my solution.

[Lesson_27.pdf](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Lesson_27.pdf) and [Lesson_28.pdf](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Lesson_28.pdf) are Rmardown files compiled via latex into pdfs that I created for a course I taught.  I compiled all my notes into a bookdown at https://bawcos.github.io/undergraduate-statistics-notes/

[LIME on RF Example.ipnyb](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Lime%20on%20RF%20Example.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook adopted from https://github.com/marcotcr/lime that I got running locally on my machine.  It demonstrates how to make a complex shallow model interpretable. 

[Names.ipnyb](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Names.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook from a project in Datacamp, http://www.datacamp.com, that I completed and added additional material.  It demonstrates obtaining data, cleaning, analyzing, and creating visual summaries.

[Kmeans.pdf](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Kmeans.pdf) is a lesson plan I wrote on the Kmeans clustering algorithm. It is done in R. The files for it are in the Kmeans folder.

[Project.pdf](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Project.pdf) is a projects I wrote for my class based on a blog from R-bloogers, https://www.r-bloggers.com/a-spell-checker-in-r/, I adapted the code and added a Bayesian component. [Project_Solution.pdf](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Project_Solution.pdf) is my solution to the project.

[Solution Manual Math 377.pdf](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/Solution%20Manual%20Math%20377.pdf) is an Rmardown file compiled into a pdf that contains my solutions to the problems assigned to my class from the book Foundatons and Applications of Statistics: An Introduction using R,http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/fast/.

[cs120_lab2_linear_regression_df.ipynb](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/cs120_lab2_linear_regression_df.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook from a course I completed on Edx called Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark.  This used the Databricks platform to run spark code.

An example of a teaching video I made is at https://goo.gl/imvVZC 

I wrote a textbook for computationally based statistics, https://bawcos.github.io/Computational-Probability-and-Statistics/

I adopted Johns Hopkins Automatic R Instructor to produce as simple demo video https://goo.gl/rBiEb6

A paper I co-authored called Understanding Neural Networks as Statistical Tools can be viewed online at https://goo.gl/qm8Cv7 

My curriculum vitae is posted in [CV online.pdf](https://github.com/BawCOS/Portfolio/blob/master/CV%20Online.pdf)
