# Portfolio

This is a repository of what I consider interesting notebooks and code.  Some are jupyter notebooks and others are RMarkdown compiled as pdf files.  I have also included links to a simple video that was created by adopting and adapting code from the Automatic R Instructor repository from Johns Hopkins.  I also have a link to a video I created with Camtasia for use in my flipped classroom.  The following is a summary of the files in this repository:

Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer - v2 with my images.ipynb - This file is from the Coursera course on convolutional neural networks https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks. I completed the code and added some additional code of my own.

Final Project Notebook 3 Solution.ipynb is a jupyter notebook I created for my course on statistical and machine learning.  I adopted a notebook from the Edx course from Databricks for my class.  This notebook is my solution.

Lesson_27.pdf and Lesson_28.pdf are Rmardown files compiled via latex into pdfs that I created for a course I taught.  I compiled all my notes into a bookdown at https://github.com/BawCOS/undergraduate-statistics-notes 

LIME on RF Example.ipnyb is a jupyter notebook adopted from https://github.com/marcotcr/lime that I got running locally on my machine.  It demonstrates how to make a complex shallow model interpretable. 

Names.ipnyb is a jupyter notebook from a project in Datacamp, http://www.datacamp.com, that I completed and added additional material.  It demonstrates obtaining data, cleaning, analyzing, and creating visual summaries.

Project.pdf is a projects I wrote for my class based on a blog from R-bloogers, https://www.r-bloggers.com/a-spell-checker-in-r/, I adapted the code and added a Bayesian component.

Project_Solution.pdf is my solution to the project.

Solution Manual Math 377.pdf is an Rmardown file compiled into a pdf that contains my solutions to the problems assigned to my class from the book Foundatons and Applications of Statistics: An Introduction using R,http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/fast/.

cs120_lab2_linear_regression_df.ipynb is a jupyter notebook from a course I completed on Edx called Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark.  This used the Databricks platform to run spark code.

An example of a teaching video I made is at https://goo.gl/imvVZC 

i adoptive Johns Hopkins Automatic R Instructor to produce as simple demo video https://goo.gl/rBiEb6

A paper I co-authored called Understanding Neural Networks as Statistical Tools can be viewed online at https://goo.gl/qm8Cv7 

My curriculum vitae is posted in CV online.pdf

I have written a book in [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) and it can be found [here](https://bawcos.github.io/undergraduate-statistics-notes/)
