This allows Google to show you relevant ads, Amazon to recommend relevant products, and Netflix to recommend movies that you might like.  This lab will demonstrate how we can use Apache Spark to recommend movies to a user.  We will start with some basic techniques, and then use the [Spark MLlib][mllib] library's Alternating Least Squares method to make more sophisticated predictions.\n \nFor this lab, we will use a subset dataset of 500,000 ratings we have included for you into your VM (and on Databricks) from the [movielens 10M stable benchmark rating dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). However, the same code you write will work for the full dataset, or their latest dataset of 21 million ratings.\n \nIn this lab:\n* *Part 0*: Preliminaries\n* *Part 1*: Basic Recommendations\n* *Part 2*: Collaborative Filtering\n* *Part 3*: Predictions for Yourself\n \nAs mentioned during the first Learning Spark lab, think carefully before calling `collect()` on any datasets.  When you are using a small dataset, calling `collect()` and then using Python to get a sense for the data locally (in the driver program) will work fine, but this will not work when you are using a large dataset that doesn't fit in memory on one machine.  Solutions that call `collect()` and do local analysis that could have been done with Spark will likely fail in the autograder and not receive full credit.\n[mllib]: https://spark.apache.org/mllib/"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Dataframes\n\nThe current version of Spark allows you to use and work with dataframes instead of RDD directly.

What we want to guarantee is that we always see the same results for a subset, independent of how we manipulate or store the data.\n \nWe can do that by sorting before we examine a subset. You might think that the most obvious choice when dealing with an RDD of tuples would be to use the [`sortByKey()` method][sortbykey]. However this choice is problematic, as we can still end up with different results if the key is not unique.\n \nNote: It is important to use the [`unicode` type](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html#the-unicode-type) instead of the `string` type as the titles are in unicode characters.\n \nConsider the following example, and note that while the sets are equal, the printed lists are usually in different order by value, *although they may randomly match up from time to time.*\n \nYou can try running this multiple times.  If the last assertion fails, don't worry about it: that was just the luck of the draw.

Since the key is an integer and the value is a unicode string, we can use a function to combine them into a single unicode string (e.g., `unicode('%.3f' % key) + ' ' + value`) before sorting the RDD using [sortBy()][sortby].\n[sortby]: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.sortBy"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def sortFunction(tuple):\n    \"\"\" Construct the sort string (does not perform actual sorting)\n    Args:\n        tuple: (rating, MovieName)\n    Returns:\n        sortString: the value to sort with, 'rating MovieName'\n    \"\"\"\n    key = unicode('%.3f' % tuple[0])\n    value = tuple[1]\n    return (key + ' ' + value)\n\n\nprint oneRDD.sortBy(sortFunction, True).collect()\nprint twoRDD.sortBy(sortFunction, True).collect()"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["If we just want to look at the first few elements of the RDD in sorted order, we can use the [takeOrdered][takeordered] method with the `sortFunction` we defined.\n[takeordered]: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.takeOrdered"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["oneSorted1 = oneRDD.takeOrdered(oneRDD.count(),key=sortFunction)\ntwoSorted1 = twoRDD.takeOrdered(twoRDD.count(),key=sortFunction)\nprint 'one is %s' % oneSorted1\nprint 'two is %s' % twoSorted1\nassert oneSorted1 == twoSorted1"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Part 1: Basic Recommendations**\n \nOne way to recommend movies is to always recommend the movies with the highest average rating.

From `ratingsRDD` create an RDD with tuples of the form (MovieID, Python iterable of Ratings for that MovieID). This transformation will yield an RDD of the form: `[(1, <pyspark.resultiterable.ResultIterable object at 0x7f16d50e7c90>), (2, <pyspark.resultiterable.ResultIterable object at 0x7f16d50e79d0>), (3, <pyspark.resultiterable.ResultIterable object at 0x7f16d50e7610>)]`. Note that you will only need to perform two Spark transformations to do this step.  You want to use a groupByKey command but since `ratingsRDD` has three items in the tuple, you need to use map to extract the MovieID and Rating into a two tuple.  Then MovieID will be the key to group on.\n* Using `movieIDsWithRatingsRDD` and your `getCountsAndAverages()` helper function, compute the number of ratings and average rating for each movie to yield tuples of the form (MovieID, (number of ratings, average rating)). This transformation will yield an RDD of the form: `[(1, (993, 4.145015105740181)), (2, (332, 3.174698795180723)), (3, (299, 3.0468227424749164))]`. You can do this step with one Spark transformation using map with your `getCountsAndAverages()` helper function.\n* We want to see movie names, instead of movie IDs. To `moviesRDD`, apply RDD transformations that use `movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD` to get the movie names for `movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD`, yielding tuples of the form (average rating, movie name, number of ratings). This set of transformations will yield an RDD of the form: `[(1.0, u'Autopsy (Macchie Solari) (1975)', 1), (1.0, u'Better Living (1998)', 1), (1.0, u'Big Squeeze, The (1996)', 3)]`. You will need to do two Spark transformations to complete this step: first use the `moviesRDD` with `movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD` to create a new RDD with Movie names matched to Movie IDs, then convert that RDD into the form of (average rating, movie name, number of ratings). These transformations will yield an RDD that looks like: `[(3.6818181818181817, u'Happiest Millionaire, The (1967)', 22), (3.0468227424749164, u'Grumpier Old Men (1995)', 299), (2.882978723404255, u'Hocus Pocus (1993)', 94)]`. This section is tricky. You will need to use a  `join` command.  By default `join` will merge on the key.  A resource to review that may help is https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.  The second transformation is a `map` but you will have to perform a deep subsetting such as `x[1][1][1]`.  You can experiment by opening an empty cell and use `take` on the `join` command to look at the RDD."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code\n\n# From ratingsRDD with tuples of (UserID, MovieID, Rating) create an RDD with tuples of\n# the (MovieID, iterable of Ratings for that MovieID)\nmovieIDsWithRatingsRDD = (ratingsRDD\n                          .map(lambda x:(x[1],x[2]))\n                         .groupByKey())\nprint 'movieIDsWithRatingsRDD: %s\\n' % movieIDsWithRatingsRDD.take(3)\n\n# Using `movieIDsWithRatingsRDD`, compute the number of ratings and average rating for each movie to\n# yield tuples of the form (MovieID, (number of ratings, average rating))\nmovieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD = movieIDsWithRatingsRDD.map(lambda x:getCountsAndAverages(x))\nprint 'movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD: %s\\n' % movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD.take(3)\n\n# To `movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD`, apply RDD transformations that use `moviesRDD` to get the movie\n# names for `movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD`, yielding tuples of the form\n# (average rating, movie name, number of ratings)\nmovieNameWithAvgRatingsRDD = (moviesRDD\n                              .join(movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD)\n                             .map(lambda x:(x[1][1][1],x[1][0],x[1][1][0])))\nprint 'movieNameWithAvgRatingsRDD: %s\\n' % movieNameWithAvgRatingsRDD.take(3)\n\nprint movieIDsWithRatingsRDD.takeOrdered(3)\nprint movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD.takeOrdered(4)\nprint movieNameWithAvgRatingsRDD.takeOrdered(20,key=lambda x: -x[0])"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TEST Movies with Highest Average Ratings (1b)\n\nTest.assertEquals(movieIDsWithRatingsRDD.count(), 3615,\n                'incorrect movieIDsWithRatingsRDD.count() (expected 3615)')\nmovieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered = movieIDsWithRatingsRDD.takeOrdered(3)\nTest.assertTrue(movieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered[0][0] == 1 and\n                len(list(movieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered[0][1])) == 993,\n                'incorrect count of ratings for movieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered[0] (expected 993)')\nTest.assertTrue(movieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered[1][0] == 2 and\n                len(list(movieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered[1][1])) == 332,\n                'incorrect count of ratings for movieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered[1] (expected 332)')\nTest.assertTrue(movieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered[2][0] == 3 and\n                len(list(movieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered[2][1])) == 299,\n                'incorrect count of ratings for movieIDsWithRatingsTakeOrdered[2] (expected 299)')\n\nTest.assertEquals(movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD.count(), 3615,\n                'incorrect movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD.count() (expected 3615)')\nTest.assertEquals(movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD.takeOrdered(3),\n                [(1, (993, 4.145015105740181)), (2, (332, 3.174698795180723)),\n                 (3, (299, 3.0468227424749164))],\n                'incorrect movieIDsWithAvgRatingsRDD.takeOrdered(3)')\n\nTest.assertEquals(movieNameWithAvgRatingsRDD.count(), 3615,\n                'incorrect movieNameWithAvgRatingsRDD.count() (expected 3615)')\nTest.assertEquals(movieNameWithAvgRatingsRDD.takeOrdered(3),\n                [(1.0, u'Autopsy (Macchie Solari) (1975)', 1), (1.0, u'Better Living (1998)', 1),\n                 (1.0, u'Big Squeeze, The (1996)', 3)],\n                 'incorrect movieNameWithAvgRatingsRDD.takeOrdered(3)')"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**(1c) Movies with Highest Average Ratings and more than 500 reviews**\n \nNow that we have an RDD of the movies with highest averge ratings, we can use Spark to determine the 20 movies with highest average ratings and more than 500 reviews.\n \nApply a single RDD transformation to `movieNameWithAvgRatingsRDD` to limit the results to movies with ratings from more than 500 people.

Spark also exposes some higher level functionality; in particular, Machine Learning using a component of Spark called [MLlib][mllib].  In this part, you will learn how to use MLlib to make personalized movie recommendations using the movie data we have been analyzing.\n \nWe are going to use a technique called [collaborative filtering][collab]. Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x than to have the opinion on x of a person chosen randomly. You can read more about collaborative filtering [here][collab2].\n \nThe image below (from [Wikipedia][collab]) shows an example of predicting of the user's rating using collaborative filtering. At first, people rate different items (like videos, images, games). After that, the system is making predictions about a user's rating for an item, which the user has not rated yet. These predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users, who have similar ratings with the active user. For instance, in the image below the system has made a prediction, that the active user will not like the video.\n![collaborative filtering](https://courses.edx.org/c4x/BerkeleyX/CS100.1x/asset/Collaborative_filtering.gif)\n \n[mllib]: https://spark.apache.org/mllib/\n[collab]: https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Collaborative_filtering\n[collab2]: http://recommender-systems.org/collaborative-filtering/"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["For movie recommendations, we start with a matrix whose entries are movie ratings by users (shown in red in the diagram below).  Each column represents a user (shown in green) and each row represents a particular movie (shown in blue).\n \nSince not all users have rated all movies, we do not know all of the entries in this matrix, which is precisely why we need collaborative filtering.  For each user, we have ratings for only a subset of the movies.  With collaborative filtering, the idea is to approximate the ratings matrix by factorizing it as the product of two matrices: one that describes properties of each user (shown in green), and one that describes properties of each movie (shown in blue).\n \n![factorization](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/matrix_factorization.png)\nWe want to select these two matrices such that the error for the users/movie pairs where we know the correct ratings is minimized.  The [Alternating Least Squares][als] algorithm does this by first randomly filling the users matrix with values and then optimizing the value of the movies such that the error is minimized.  Then, it holds the movies matrix constrant and optimizes the value of the user's matrix.  This alternation between which matrix to optimize is the reason for the \"alternating\" in the name.\n \nThis optimization is what's being shown on the right in the image above.  Given a fixed set of user factors (i.e., values in the users matrix), we use the known ratings to find the best values for the movie factors using the optimization written at the bottom of the figure.  Then we \"alternate\" and pick the best user factors given fixed movie factors.\n \nFor a simple example of what the users and movies matrices might look like, check out the [videos from Lecture 8][videos] or the [slides from Lecture 8][slides]\n[videos]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS100.1x/1T2015/courseware/00eb8b17939b4889a41a6d8d2f35db83/3bd3bba368be4102b40780550d3d8da6/\n[slides]: https://courses.edx.org/c4x/BerkeleyX/CS100.1x/asset/Week4Lec8.pdf\n[als]: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Least-Squares_Method"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**(2a) Creating a Training Set**\nBefore we jump into using machine learning, we need to break up the `ratingsRDD` dataset into three pieces:\n* A training set (RDD), which we will use to train models\n* A validation set (RDD), which we will use to choose the best model\n* A test set (RDD), which we will use for our experiments\nTo randomly split the dataset into the multiple groups, we can use the pySpark [randomSplit()](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.randomSplit) transformation. `randomSplit()` takes a set of splits and and seed and returns multiple RDDs."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["trainingRDD, validationRDD, testRDD = ratingsRDD.randomSplit([6, 2, 2], seed=0L)\n\nprint 'Training: %s, validation: %s, test: %s\\n' % (trainingRDD.count(),\n                                                    validationRDD.count(),\n                                                    testRDD.count())\nprint trainingRDD.take(3)\nprint validationRDD.take(3)\nprint testRDD.take(3)\n\nassert trainingRDD.count() == 292716\nassert validationRDD.count() == 96902\nassert testRDD.count() == 98032\n\nassert trainingRDD.filter(lambda t: t == (1, 914, 3.0)).count() == 1\nassert trainingRDD.filter(lambda t: t == (1, 2355, 5.0)).count() == 1\nassert trainingRDD.filter(lambda t: t == (1, 595, 5.0)).count() == 1\n\nassert validationRDD.filter(lambda t: t == (1, 1287, 5.0)).count() == 1\nassert validationRDD.filter(lambda t: t == (1, 594, 4.0)).count() == 1\nassert validationRDD.filter(lambda t: t == (1, 1270, 5.0)).count() == 1\n\nassert testRDD.filter(lambda t: t == (1, 1193, 5.0)).count() == 1\nassert testRDD.filter(lambda t: t == (1, 2398, 4.0)).count() == 1\nassert testRDD.filter(lambda t: t == (1, 1035, 5.0)).count() == 1"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":34},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["After splitting the dataset, your training set has about 293,000 entries and the validation and test sets each have about 97,000 entries (the exact number of entries in each dataset varies slightly due to the random nature of the `randomSplit()` transformation."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**(2b) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**\n \nIn the next part, you will generate a few different models, and will need a way to decide which model is best. We will use the [Root Mean Square Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) (RMSE) or Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) to compute the error of each model.  RMSE is a frequently used measure of the differences between values (sample and population values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values actually observed. The RMSD represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between predicted values and observed values. These individual differences are called residuals when the calculations are performed over the data sample that was used for estimation, and are called prediction errors when computed out-of-sample. The RMSE serves to aggregate the magnitudes of the errors in predictions for various times into a single measure of predictive power. RMSE is a good measure of accuracy, but only to compare forecasting errors of different models for a particular variable and not between variables, as it is scale-dependent.\n \nThe RMSE is the square root of the average value of the square of `(actual rating - predicted rating)` for all users and movies for which we have the actual rating. Versions of Spark MLlib beginning with Spark 1.4 include a [RegressionMetrics](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.evaluation.RegressionMetrics) module that can be used to compute the RMSE. However, since we are using Spark 1.3.1, we will write our own function.\n \nWrite a function to compute the sum of squared error given `predictedRDD` and `actualRDD` RDDs. Both RDDs consist of tuples of the form (UserID, MovieID, Rating)\n \nGiven two ratings RDDs, *x* and *y* of size *n*, we define RSME as follows: \\\\( RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}{n}}\\\\)\n \nTo calculate RSME, the steps you should perform are:\n* Transform `predictedRDD` into the tuples of the form ((UserID, MovieID), Rating). For example, tuples like `[((1, 1), 5), ((1, 2), 3), ((1, 3), 4), ((2, 1), 3), ((2, 2), 2), ((2, 3), 4)]`. You can perform this step with a single Spark transformation.\n* Transform `actualRDD` into the tuples of the form ((UserID, MovieID), Rating). For example, tuples like `[((1, 2), 3), ((1, 3), 5), ((2, 1), 5), ((2, 2), 1)]`. You can perform this step with a single Spark transformation.\n* Using only RDD transformations (you only need to perform two transformations), compute the squared error for each *matching* entry (i.e., the same (UserID, MovieID) in each RDD) in the reformatted RDDs - do *not* use `collect()` to perform this step. Note that not every (UserID, MovieID) pair will appear in both RDDs - if a pair does not appear in both RDDs, then it does not contribute to the RMSE. You will end up with an RDD with entries of the form \\\\( (x_i - y_i)^2\\\\) You might want to check out Python's [math](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html) module to see how to compute these values\n* Using an RDD action (but **not** `collect()`), compute the total squared error: \\\\( SE = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 \\\\)\n* Compute *n* by using an RDD action (but **not** `collect()`), to count the number of pairs for which you computed the total squared error\n* Using the total squared error and the number of pairs, compute the RSME. Make sure you compute this value as a [float](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex).\n \nNote: Your solution must only use transformations and actions on RDDs.

ALS takes a training dataset (RDD) and several parameters that control the model creation process. To determine the best values for the parameters, we will use ALS to train several models, and then we will select the best model and use the parameters from that model in the rest of this lab exercise.\n \nThe process we will use for determining the best model is as follows:\n* Pick a set of model parameters. The most important parameter to `ALS.train()` is the *rank*, which is the number of rows in the Users matrix (green in the diagram above) or the number of columns in the Movies matrix (blue in the diagram above). (In general, a lower rank will mean higher error on the training dataset, but a high rank may lead to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).)  We will train models with ranks of 4, 8, and 12 using the `trainingRDD` dataset.\n* Create a model using `ALS.train(trainingRDD, rank, seed=seed, iterations=iterations, lambda_=regularizationParameter)` with three parameters: an RDD consisting of tuples of the form (UserID, MovieID, rating) used to train the model, an integer rank (4, 8, or 12), a number of iterations to execute (we will use 5 for the `iterations` parameter), and a regularization coefficient (we will use 0.1 for the `regularizationParameter`).\n* For the prediction step, create an input RDD, `validationForPredictRDD`, consisting of (UserID, MovieID) pairs that you extract from `validationRDD`. You will end up with an RDD of the form: `[(1, 1287), (1, 594), (1, 1270)]`\n* Using the model and `validationForPredictRDD`, we can predict rating values by calling [model.predictAll()](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.recommendation.MatrixFactorizationModel.predictAll) with the `validationForPredictRDD` dataset, where `model` is the model we generated with ALS.train().  `predictAll` accepts an RDD with each entry in the format (userID, movieID) and outputs an RDD with each entry in the format (userID, movieID, rating).\n* Evaluate the quality of the model by using the `computeError()` function you wrote in part (2b) to compute the error between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings in `validationRDD`.\n \nWhich rank produces the best model, based on the RMSE with the `validationRDD` dataset?\n \n>Note: It is likely that this operation will take a noticeable amount of time (around a minute in our VM); you can observe its progress on the [Spark Web UI](http://localhost:4040).

You will end up with an RDD of the form: `[(1, 1287), (1, 594), (1, 1270)]`\n* Use [myModel.predictAll()](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.recommendation.MatrixFactorizationModel.predictAll) to predict rating values for the test dataset.\n* For validation, use the `testRDD`and your `computeError` function to compute the RMSE between `testRDD` and the `predictedTestRDD` from the model.\n* Evaluate the quality of the model by using the `computeError()` function you wrote in part (2b) to compute the error between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings in `testRDD`."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code\nmyModel = ALS.train(trainingRDD, bestRank, seed=seed, iterations=iterations,\n                      lambda_=regularizationParameter)\ntestForPredictingRDD = testRDD.map(lambda x:(x[0],x[1]))\npredictedTestRDD = myModel.predictAll(testForPredictingRDD)\n\ntestRMSE = computeError(testRDD, predictedTestRDD)\n\nprint 'The model had a RMSE on the test set of %s' % testRMSE"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":43},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TEST Testing Your Model (2d)\nTest.assertTrue(abs(testRMSE - 0.87809838344) < tolerance, 'incorrect testRMSE: %.11f' % testRMSE)"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":44},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Let's try on rank 2\nmyModel = ALS.train(trainingRDD, 2, seed=seed, iterations=iterations,\n                      lambda_=regularizationParameter)\ntestForPredictingRDD = testRDD.map(lambda x:(x[0],x[1]))\npredictedTestRDD = myModel.predictAll(testForPredictingRDD)\n\ntestRMSE = computeError(testRDD, predictedTestRDD)\n\nprint 'The model had a RMSE on the test set using rank 2 of %s' % testRMSE"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":45},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**(2e) Comparing Your Model**\n \nLooking at the RMSE for the results predicted by the model versus the values in the test set is one way to evalute the quality of our model.
